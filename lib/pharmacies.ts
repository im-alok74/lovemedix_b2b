/**
 * Local discovery — the queries behind "what can I actually get, near me, right now".
 *
 * Everything here is driven by real rows: verified pharmacies, their coordinates, their
 * live inventory and their opening hours. Nothing is simulated. When there is no data the
 * functions return an empty array and the calling surface renders an honest empty state
 * rather than filler.
 *
 * Matching is deliberately layered, because customers arrive with different amounts of
 * information about themselves:
 *
 *   coordinates → real distance, ranked nearest first
 *   pincode     → exact pincode match
 *   city        → city match
 *   nothing     → every verified pharmacy, best-stocked first
 *
 * Distance is computed with the haversine formula in SQL. That is accurate to well under
 * the error in a rooftop geocode at city scale, and it avoids pulling every pharmacy row
 * into the application to sort it there. If the pharmacy table ever grows past a few
 * thousand rows in one city, this is the point to add PostGIS and a GiST index.

/**
 * A note on what happens when a customer's location matches nothing.
 *
 * Most partner pharmacies have no coordinates yet — registration does not capture them —
 * so distance is often unknown. The tempting fix is to fall back to "show every partner
 * anyway while the network is small". That was tried and removed: it put a pharmacy in
 * Nalanda under a "Pharmacies near you" heading for a customer in Mumbai, which is
 * inventing proximity we have not measured.
 *
 * So a located customer sees only real geographic matches — pincode, city, or a measured
 * distance — and an empty result renders the empty state, which offers a prescription
 * upload, WhatsApp and a phone number. That is a true answer with a way forward, rather
 * than a false one. A visitor who has shared no location at all is a different case: they
 * asked nothing about proximity, so they get the partner list under a neutral heading.
 *
 * The way to make more pharmacies appear is to geocode them, not to loosen this.
