/**
 * Image source validation for `next/image`.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * `next/image` throws when `src` is an absolute URL whose host is not listed in
 * `next.config.mjs` `images.remotePatterns`. That throw happens during render, so it takes
 * out the whole page — and because the failure occurs after streaming has begun, the
 * response still returns HTTP 200 with an error boundary painted over it.
 *
 * `medicines.image_url` is free text filled in by data entry and bulk uploads. Six rows
 * currently hold values that are not images at all — Google search and `/imgres` redirect
 * links pasted from a browser address bar, plus a few strings that are not URLs. Each of
 * those rows was enough to break its entire product page.
 *
 * The rule this enforces: **a bad row degrades to a placeholder, it never breaks a page.**
 * Validating at the boundary is the durable fix; cleaning the six rows is housekeeping that
 * does not stop the seventh from being pasted tomorrow.
