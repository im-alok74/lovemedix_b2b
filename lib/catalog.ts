 * than running eight separate GROUP BY queries against the same 92 rows, and it keeps all
 * the "what counts as a deal / a category / a brand" logic in one readable place.
 *
 * The trade is that this loads the whole stocked set into memory. That is correct up to a
 * few thousand SKUs. Past that, push the grouping back into SQL — the shapes returned
 * here are the contract, so the rails would not need to change.
 *
 * Nothing here fabricates anything. Every rail returns fewer items when there is less
 * stock, and returns nothing at all when a section could not be filled honestly.
