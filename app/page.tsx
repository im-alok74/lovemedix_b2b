/**
 * Homepage.
 *
 * Rebuilt around one finding: the page was a brochure. Roughly 1,700 words, four
 * photographs, no `font-bold` anywhere, ten separate prescription calls-to-action, and
 * nine section headings styled identically so nothing looked more important than anything
 * else. For someone in Patna on a cheap Android that is a wall of small grey text with
 * nothing to look at.
 *
 * The rebuild inverts that. Every shopping section leads with real photography from live
 * pharmacy inventory, headings are bold and sized in three tiers, body copy has a 16px
 * floor, and there is exactly one prescription CTA in the page body.
 *
 * Sections are ordered by what a first-time visitor needs, and every data-driven one
 * returns `null` rather than rendering a heading over an empty grid — so an early-stage
 * marketplace reads as a short, deliberate page instead of a broken one.
